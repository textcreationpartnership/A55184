            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE LAST SPEECH and CONFESSION OF Oliver Plunket <hi>Titular</hi> Primate <hi>of</hi> Ireland; <hi>with an Account of his Behavior in</hi> Newgate, <hi>since his</hi> Condemnation. And also of Edward Fitz-Harris: At their EXECUTION at TYBURN, upon <hi>Fryday, July</hi> 1. 1681. For HIGH-TREASON, in Conspiring the Death of the <hi>KING,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>FRyday</hi> the first of <hi>July,</hi> being appointed by his Majesties Warrant, for the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Oliver Pluncket</hi> and <hi>Edward Fitz-Harris,</hi> they had some days notice given them thereof, in order to prepare themselves for Eternity; during which time several persons of Quality came to visit them, and Discoursed them concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the horrid Crimes whereof they were found Guilty, to whom Mr. <hi>Plunket,</hi> (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Popish Mode</hi>) denied his being any way concerned or Guilty of the matters Charged against him, insisting much upon his not having his Witnesses ready to Vindicate his Innocency; yet owning he had received divers Summs of Money, which he alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were given him for the Relief of the Inferior Clergy, which he, as their Bishop di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed among them, repeating likewise many of those things which he urged at his Tryal, but especially at his Condemnation, and particularly his being Tryed in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for Facts said to be committed in <hi>Ireland;</hi> adding, That if he had been Tryed there, he did not question but he should have been cleared. But however he said his Soul was now so well prepared for another World, that he did not desire to continue any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in this, since he doubted whether ever he should attain to the same Temper of Mind again, and (contrary to the usual Roman Uncharitableness) desired all good Christians to pray for him.</p>
            <p>Last Night about 5 a Clock, Mr. <hi>Pluncket</hi> desired Captain <hi>Richardson</hi> that he might retire himself to his private Devotions, and that no person whatsoever might be permitted to disturb him, nor to come to him till morning, which was accordingly done, and we hear, That some of his Friends told him, They had begged his Body.</p>
            <p>Between Nine and ten a Clock this Morning, the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> attended by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Richardson</hi> went to <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> and there received the Body of <hi>Edward Fitz-Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> from the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> who being put into a Sled, prepared for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, was drawn from thence through <hi>Cornhil</hi> and <hi>Cheap-side</hi> to <hi>Newgate,</hi> where <hi>Oliver Pluncket</hi> being also put into a Sled, they were both drawn from thence to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> there being a multitude of Spectators all the way as they passed. Mr. <hi>Pluncket</hi> came first to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> and as soon as he was taken out of the Sled, and put in the Cart, he crossed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thrice upon the Brest, and then delivered a Paper to the Sheriff, which he desired might be Published; He then asked whether he might have liberty to speak, and it was told him, He might, and the Executioner having fitted the Rope to his Neck, he began with very solemn Protestations to declare, That he was sensible he was now going to appear before the Just Judge of Heaven and Earth, and that if he did not now speak the Truth he should be Damned to all Eternity, and then he proceeded to Declare what he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of, which he divided into five or six particulars, and then he repeated the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations, which he had formerly used, denying his having any manner of Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with the <hi>French King,</hi> or his Confessor, and alleadging the Impossibility of Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Army of Seaventy Thousand men in that place which the Witnesses Swore to,
<pb facs="tcp:101619:2"/>and likewise of the improbality of their maintaining them, who could hardly keep Cloths to their backs, and were not all able to provide for half a Regiment.</p>
            <p>He said, That he had been accused in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and cleared, and that he was now Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, where the Jury could take no Cognizance of the likelyhood or improbability of the matter; and that he had endeavoured to reform some irregularities of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy in that Kingdom, which had occasioned much hatred against him; and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Old Protestation, <hi>That he was as Innocent as the Child unborn</hi> is now grown Threadbare, He said, <hi>That, as he hoped for Salvation, he was altogether Innocent of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing whatsoever which was charged against him,</hi> which he said he affirmed to be absolutely true, according to the common and usual meaning of such words among Protestants, without any manner of Equivocation or mental Reservation whatsoever; Asserting, That he did not believe that any man or power upon earth whatsoever could dispense with Lying at such a time as that: He then prayed that it would please God to bless his Majesty, the Queen, the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and all the Royal Family, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with forgiving all the World, and desiring pardon of all those whom he had offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then recommended his Soul to the mercy of God, through the Merits of Jesus Christ our Saviour, and the Blessed Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> Declaring that he dyed a <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, which Religion he had long continued in, and was resolved to dye in; after which he pulled his Cap over his eyes, and continued in his private Devotions above half an hour.</p>
            <p>During which time, Mr. <hi>Edward Fitz-Harris</hi> was brought thither, and as soon as he came under the Gallows, Dr. <hi>Hawkins,</hi> Minister of the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> stept into the Sledg to him, and kneeling down, discoursed privately with him for some time; Then Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was put into the Cart, and the Doctor coming up to him, Mr. Sheriff asked Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> if he had any thing to say, who answered he had delivered two Papers to Dr. <hi>Hawkins,</hi> upon which the Doctor produced one of them and delivered it to Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> desiring him to read it, which he accordingly did, it being an half sheet of paper on one side, wherein he did deny he was any ways concerned in the Libel for which he suffered, any farther then the discovering to his Majesty the Designs and Practises of some Persons, reflecting likewise upon Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> and the other Witnesses, and some other persons who had fail'd him at his Tryal.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheriff then desired him to Confess what he knew, and if possible to prevent the shedding of Innocent Blond, reminding him, what he had said, when in <hi>Newgate,</hi> that he knew more of the Popish Plot than any other; But Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> said, He had left his Mind with Dr. <hi>Hawkins:</hi> Then Mr. Sheriff desired to know, Whether he died a Protestant or a Papist? and Dr. <hi>Martin</hi> of St. <hi>Mary Overys</hi> inforced the same, asking him, How it stood between God and his Soul, and wishing him to declare, Whether he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or a <hi>Roman Catholick?</hi> telling him, That he needed not to be ashamed of dying a Protestant, but he still evaded to give any Answer, referring all to what he had given to Dr. <hi>Hawkins,</hi> and that he had no more to say: The Sheriffs then desired Dr. <hi>Hawkins,</hi> to deliver them the Papers, the Dr. reply'd, That they should have a Coppy of that which Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> had read, but for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paper, he should deliver it only to those whom it properly concerned, or to that purpose. Then Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> asked the Sherriffs, Whether they had not an Order concerning his Body, that it should not be broken (as he called it) or quartered, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Mr. Sheriff <hi>Cornish</hi> read the Order to him, which was, That after Execution, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Sentence was done upon him, his Head and Quarters should be delivered to his Wife, Mrs. <hi>Ann Fitz-Harris:</hi> He said, He thought he should not have been Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; Then Dr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> Kneeled down with him in the Cart, and prayed, or discoursed privately with him, and the Doctor going out of the Cart, prayed God to have Mercy on his Soul.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Fitz Harris</hi> then pulled his Cap over his Eyes, and prayed to himself, and then put his Cap up again, and desired Dr. <hi>Hawkins</hi> to take care of his Body, to which the Doctor Answered, <hi>It was a very unbecoming Employment for him, and that others were appointed for that purpose;</hi> The Doctor likewise declaring, That he desired the Prayers of all there present, which Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> hearing, put up his Cap again, and said, <hi>I desire all your prayers for an happy Passage;</hi> and in a short time after the Cart being drawn away, they were both turned off: Mr. <hi>Plunket</hi> was Dead in a short time, but Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> by staggering in the Cart brought the Noose just behind the Pole of his Neck, so that he was some what longer a-dying. After they had hanged a confiderable time, they were both Beheaded and Quartered, and their Quarters delivered to their Friends, according to the afore-mentioned Order.</p>
